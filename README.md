# How to Become a Broker on Orderly Network

Hi there — welcome!

If you're reading this, I’m guessing you’re interested in becoming a broker partner with Orderly Network — that’s great to hear!
Becoming a broker on Orderly Network gives you the opportunity to build trading applications, earn trading fees, and leverage the powerful infrastructure of our omnichain orderbook network.

This guide walks you through the full broker onboarding process.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Get in Touch with the Orderly Team

Start by reaching out to someone from the Orderly team directly — either via official contact channels like [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/orderlynetwork) and [Telegram](https://t.me/Orderly_Discussions), the business development manager, or through [Orderly's website](https://orderly.network).

Once connected, the team will guide you through setting up your broker profile.

---

## 📝 Step 2: Provide Initial Broker Information

You will need to confirm the following details for your broker profile:

- Broker ID: xxx
- Broker Name: XXX
- Default Taker Fee: 0.06%
- Default Maker Fee: 0.03%


These informations are pre-filled with typical rates — you can confirm, or adjust them later after setup.

### About Fees:

- **Orderly charges** a base fee of **0.03%** taker fee and **0% maker fee**.
- **Anything above the base is your profit.**
  
For example:  
If you set a taker fee of 0.06%, you **earn** 0.03% (0.06% - 0.03%).

### 🔥 Public Tier vs Staking Tier

You must also decide whether you want to:
- **Start in the Public Tier** (based on volume thresholds), or
- **Stake ORDER tokens** to instantly qualify for better fee share tiers.

>[!NOTE]  
>Once you choose your initial path (public or staking tier), it defines your starting broker privileges — but you can change later if your circumstances evolve.

## 🛠 Step 3: Broker Profile Setup by Orderly

After receiving your broker details, the Orderly team will:

- Register your broker profile internally.
- Assign your Broker ID.
- Configure default fees and permissions.

⏳ This process typically takes **1 to 2 business days**.

You will be notified once your broker profile is ready.

---

## 🔐 Step 4: Register Your Admin Account

Once the broker profile is created, you will register your **admin account**.  
This admin account:
- Is **linked to the Broker ID**.
- Allows you to **manage your broker settings**.
- Collects your **earned trading fees**.

### How to register:

1. Visit the [Broker Registration Tool](https://github-dev.orderly.network/broker-registration/).

2. Connect your wallet and complete the registration flow.

3. After successful registration, you will receive:

```
 Orderly Public Key: ed25519:xxxxxxxxxxxx
 Orderly Private Key: ed25519:xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

These credentials are required to access your admin account. Once this step is completed, it means you have successfully registered an account on Orderly and is associated with your wallet address.


4. Submit your **wallet's public address**(not Orderly public key) securely to the Orderly team.

>[!IMPORTANT]  
>Treat the Private Key like a secret password — never expose it publicly, even the Orderly team.
It is critical for signing requests and accessing broker functions.

✅ Once your wallet address is received, the Orderly team will complete the final linkage in the backend. And you should have access to the [broker admin portal](admin.orderly.network) by then.

# 💬 FAQs
